# evergreen

A frontend for the [Evergreen CI system](https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen), implemented as an Emacs
package. The controls and appearance take heavy inspiration from [`magit`](https://github.com/magit/magit),
[`dired`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html), and, of course, the Evergreen web UI
itself.

## Installation

Download the latest release tarball from the "Releases" tab on GitHub and use <kbd>M-x package-install-file</kbd> on it.
